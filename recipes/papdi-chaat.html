    <h3>Ingrediants ~</h3>

    <div class="ingrediants-list">
        <li>1/4 c. ghee or butter</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. ajwain seeds</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. nigella seeds</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp. white sesame seeds</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp. black sesame seeds</li>
        <li>1/2 c. whole-wheat flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 c. all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt to taste</li>
        <li> 3/4 tsp. black salt</li>
        <li>6 to 8 tbsp. water</li>
    </div>
    <h3>Steps ~</h3>
    <div class="steps-list">
        <li>In a medium pan over medium-low heat, melt ghee. Add in seeds and toast, swirling pan occasionally until white sesame seeds are lightly golden, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and let cool.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix together flours and salt. Stir in cooled ghee mixture and use your fingers to work the ghee evenly into the flour mixture.Stir in water and knead into a cohesive ball of dough. Cover and let rest for 30 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Halve dough, then roll each piece to about ⅛” in thickness. Prick dough all over with a fork, then cut out rounds using a 2” cookie cutter. Transfer to a baking sheet or large plate lined with parchment. Repeat with remaining dough. Reroll all scraps together into another sheet to punch out more rounds (or fry as is for snacking!).</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a large pot on medium heat, heat 1” of vegetable oil to between 350° and 375°. </li>
        <li>Being sure not to overcrowd the pan, fry papdi in batches, stirring occasionally, until evenly golden, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to low if papdis are turning dark gold too soon. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and repeat with remaining papdi.</li>
